\section{Conclusion}

We have presented Meteor, an extension to Spark designed to avoid bandwidth-heavy communication in a highly distributed environment such as multiple data centers or cellular towers. We have implemented data locality and bandwidth-aware work-stealing as part of the Spark scheduler. Through a prototype  deployment on emulab,  we show that both techniques result in significant latency and bandwidth usage improvements. We also explore the promise of approximation analytics for iterative queries, specifically PageRank, and show that selective updates to global data structures can save bandwidth usage while sacrificing only a little accuracy.
