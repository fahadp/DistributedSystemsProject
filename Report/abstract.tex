We present Meteor, a system optimized for MapReduce tasks on geographically dispersed 
data. We envision a highly distributed environment such as a network of cell towers or data 
centers on a WAN. Traditional solutions for this problem involve all or most of the input and intermediate
data backhauled to a central location, making analytics slow and expensive. This is particularly the case for MapReduce-like systems that rely on an all-to-all communication model for input and aggregation. Meteor avoids this by performing as much of the processing and aggregation at the level of an individual datacenter as possible, thus minimizing communication on bandwidth-limited links. For skewed data partitions, Meteor uses a bandwidth-aware work stealing policy to perform remote map operations selectively. We also explore approximation strategies for iterative queries as an application level heuristic to reduce bandwidth usage. We implement Meteor as an extension to Apache Spark, an open source in-memory cluster computing stack \cite{rdd}.
